# AnhyLingo

<span style="box-sizing: border-box; text-decoration-line: underline;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;">AnhyLingo</span></span> is a plugin for Minecraft servers designed to create a multilingual interface. It allows players to receive system messages, messages from other plugins, as well as see names and descriptions of items in their chosen language.

A common limitation of many Minecraft plugins is their confinement to a single language, as defined in the plugin's configuration. Few plugins offer true multilingual support, often relying solely on the language of the Minecraft client.

<span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;">AnhyLingo</span> stands out in this landscape. It not only utilizes the client's language settings but also empowers players to choose multiple languages in a specified order for finding appropriate translations. Furthermore, <span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;">AnhyLingo</span> makes almost any in-game chat message multilingual by using language keys. These keys are replaced with corresponding translations during the server-to-client packet transmission, ensuring that messages are delivered in the player's chosen language.

Moreover, <span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;">AnhyLingo</span> brings multilingual capabilities to scenarios where it seemed improbable. For instance, when creating quests with a quest plugin, even if the plugin itself is multilingual, the quest messages are typically restricted to one language. <span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;">AnhyLingo</span> innovatively addresses this by allowing creators to use keys from custom language files, enabling the quests to be multilingual. This versatility greatly enhances the gaming experience, making it more inclusive and accessible to a diverse, global player base.

In conclusion, <span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;">AnhyLingo</span> transcends the typical boundaries of language in Minecraft, offering a versatile and inclusive solution that enriches the gaming experience for a diverse, global player base.
